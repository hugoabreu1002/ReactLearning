# Introduction

My website idea is a franchisible restaurant / delivery / marketplace for vegan food. Crocanos. The name comes from the portuguese word "croncante" (crunchy).
The idea came after a personal pain, one day me and my wife, wich is the true vegan person on our relashionship would like to order vegan food here in Brazil, we tried to use ifood, a local food delivery service very similar with ubereats, but options were just a few. This day, we came up with this business idea.

By 2018, 14% of the 200 million brazilians were vegetarians, and almost 42% adopt a diet with no meat in at least on day of the week [1]. This number could be larger by 2023, so we expect to reach at least 100 million people just in our country.

Around the globe, the vegan market is rising at a good rate as we can see in [7]. On the chart we see that b 2030 the vegan market will reach 65 billion USDollars.

However, the vegan market is mostly live offline, and whe want to change that [7].

Our goal is to make people enjoy vegan food as very practical and delicious service, while being able to prepare their own delicious meals at the confort of home.

# Expected List of Features

The needed features for the website are:

* Order menu: to order locally on each restaurant.
* Fast menu: to order fast food plates to go. The plates here my diverge from the local order menu, because needs to be fast and fresh, fast running.
* Delivery Menu: to order remotly in home. Can be made up of the two kinds of menus above.
* Marketplace: where you could order pre-maid ingridients to make your own plates from the fast menu. The could be delivery in the same city of order for some plates or same region. The ingridients here needs to be dried and delivery in vacuum sealed packages.
* User space: an space where the user will be able to check it's current order and manage other personal informations, like address and credit cards. Here, the user could subscribe as a deliver person as well, after passing through some tests and crontract.
* Vegan network: an space where each used could share their experience with the website, sharing photos and posts, and also invinting others for events.
* Carbon credit selling: an space where the service will actuall sell carbon credit.

# Market Survey

Here in Brazil we have iFood [2]. However ifood is not speciallized with vegan food. Actually each franchise will be an ifood client as well. Because it is the most used food delivery service. Another point is that ifood doesn't work with pre-maid food, only delivery food and groceries.

Other service, Ubear eats [3], is mostly like iFood but with a business rule where the uber driver can also deliver food and groceries.

In Uk there is the veganmarkets [4] wich focus on organizing local producers in some london neighbours, in festival like events. That's a pretty cool feature that we want to create as well.

Another cool website is veganblackmarket [5] wich has the features expected for our market place side of the business, like filtering the type of items and departments, like: pet care, baby, vitamins & suplements, sports nutrition and many others.

Finally, there is velivery [6], a marketplace with tons variety of products where it can actually filter the products by brands.
